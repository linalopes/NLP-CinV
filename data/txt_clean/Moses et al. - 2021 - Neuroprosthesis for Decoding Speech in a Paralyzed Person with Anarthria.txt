ABSTRACT

BACKGROUND

Technology to restore the ability to communicate in paralyzed persons who cannot speak has the potential to improve autonomy and quality of life. An approach that decodes words and sentences directly from the cerebral cortical activity of such patients may represent an advancement over existing methods for assisted communication.

METHODS

We implanted a subdural, high-density, multielectrode array over the area of the sensorimotor cortex that controls speech in a person with anarthria (the loss of the ability to articulate speech) and spastic quadriparesis caused by a brain-stem stroke. Over the course of 48 sessions, we recorded 22 hours of cortical activity while the participant attempted to say individual words from a vocabulary set of 50 words. We used deep-learning algorithms to create computational models for the detection and classification of words from patterns in the recorded cortical activity.  We  applied  these  computational  models,  as  well  as  a  natural-language model  that  yielded  next-word  probabilities  given  the  preceding  words  in  a  sequence, to decode full sentences as the participant attempted to say them.

RESULTS

We decoded sentences  from  the  participant's  cortical  activity  in  real  time  at  a median rate of 15.2 words per minute, with a median word error rate of 25.6%. In post hoc analyses, we detected 98% of the attempts by the participant to produce individual words, and we classified words with 47.1% accuracy using cortical signals that were stable throughout the 81-week study period.

CONCLUSIONS

In  a  person  with  anarthria  and  spastic  quadriparesis  caused  by  a  brain-stem stroke, words and sentences were decoded directly from cortical activity during attempted speech with the use of deep-learning models and a natural-language model.

A to articulate speech. It can result from narthria is the loss of the ability a variety of conditions, including stroke and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.  Patients with 1 anarthria  may  have  intact  language  skills  and cognition, and some are able to produce limited oral  movements  and  undifferentiated  vocalizations when attempting to speak. 2 However, paralyzed persons may be unable to operate assistive devices because of severe impairment of movement.  Anarthria  hinders  communication  with family, friends, and caregivers, thereby reducing patient-reported  quality  of  life.   Advances  have 3 been  made  with  typing-based  brain-computer interfaces that allow speech-impaired persons to spell out messages by controlling a computer cursor. 4-8 However, letter-by-letter selection through interfaces driven by neural signal recordings is slow and effortful. A more efficient and natural approach may be to directly decode whole words from brain areas that control speech. Our understanding  of  how  the  area  of  the  sensorimotor cortex that controls speech orchestrates the rapid articulatory  movements  of  the  vocal  tract  has expanded. 9-14 Engineering efforts have used these neurobiologic findings, together with advances in machine learning, to show that speech can be decoded from brain activity in persons without speech impairments. 15-19

In paralyzed persons who cannot speak, recordings of neural activity cannot be precisely aligned with intended speech because of the absence of speech output, which poses an obstacle for training computational models. 20 In addition, it is unclear whether neural signals underlying speech control are still intact in persons who have not spoken for years or decades. In earlier work, a paralyzed person used an implanted, intracortical,  two-channel  microelectrode  device  and  an audiovisual  interface  to  generate  vowel  sounds and phonemes but not full words. 21,22 To determine whether speech can be directly decoded to produce language from the neural activity of a person who is unable to speak, we tested realtime decoding of words and sentences from the cortical activity of a person with limb paralysis and anarthria caused by a brain-stem stroke.

Methods

Study Overview

This  work  was  performed  as  part  of  the  BCI Restoration  of  Arm  and  Voice  (BRAVO)  study, which  is  a  single-institution  clinical  study  to evaluate the potential of electrocorticography, a method  for  recording  neural  activity  from  the cerebral cortex with the use of electrodes placed on the surface of the cerebral hemisphere, and custom decoding techniques to enable communication and mobility. An investigational device exemption for the device used in this study was approved by the Food and Drug Administration. As of this writing, the device had been implanted only in the participant described here. Because of regulatory and clinical considerations regarding the proper handling of the percutaneous connector, the participant did not have the opportunity  to  use  the  system  independently  for  daily activities but underwent testing at his home.

This work was approved by the Committee on Human Research at the University of California, San Francisco, and was supported in part by a research contract under Facebook's Sponsored Academic Research Agreement. All the authors were involved in the design and execution of the clinical  study;  the  collection,  storage,  analysis, and interpretation of the data; and the writing of  the  manuscript.  No  study  hardware  or  data were transferred to any sponsor, and we did not receive any hardware or software from a sponsor to use in this work. All the authors vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and for the fidelity of the study to the protocol (available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org) and confirm that the study was conducted ethically. Informed consent was obtained from the participant after the reason for and nature of implantation and the training procedures and risks were thoroughly explained to him.

Participant

The  participant  was  a  right-handed  man  who was 36 years of age at the start of the study. At 20 years of age, he had had an extensive pontine stroke associated with a dissection of the right vertebral artery, which resulted in severe spastic quadriparesis and anarthria, as confirmed by a speech-language pathologist  and  neurologists (Video 1 and Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, both available at NEJM.org). His cognitive function was intact, and he had a score of 26 on the Mini-Mental State Examination (scores range from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating better mental performance); because of his paralysis, it was not physically possible for his score to reach 30. He was able to vocalize grunts

and moans but was unable to produce intelligible speech; eye movement was unaffected. He normally communicated using an assistive computer-based  typing  interface  controlled  by  his residual head movements; his typing speed was approximately  5  correct  words  or  18  correct characters per minute (Section S1).

Implant Device

The neural implant used to acquire brain signals from the participant was a customized combination of a high-density electrocorticography electrode  array  (manufactured  by  PMT)  and  a percutaneous connector (manufactured by Blackrock Microsystems). The rectangular electrode array was 6.7 cm long, 3.5 cm wide, and 0.51 mm thick  and  consisted  of  128  flat,  disk-shaped electrodes arranged in a 16-by-8 lattice formation, with a center-to-center distance between adjacent  electrodes  of  4  mm.  During  surgical implantation, general anesthesia was used, and the sensorimotor cortex of the left hemisphere, as  identified  by  anatomical  landmarks  of  the central sulcus, was exposed through craniotomy. The electrode array was laid on the pial surface of  the  brain  in  the  subdural  space.  The  electrode coverage enabled sampling from multiple cortical  regions  that  have  been  implicated  in speech  processing,  including  portions  of  the left precentral gyrus, postcentral gyrus, posterior middle frontal gyrus, and posterior inferior frontal gyrus. 9,11-13 The dura was closed with sutures, and the cranial bone flap was replaced. The percutaneous connector was placed extracranially  on  the  contralateral  skull  convexity and anchored to the cranium. This percutaneous  connector  conducts  cortical  signals  from the implanted electrode array through externally accessible contacts to a detachable digital link and cable, enabling transmission of the acquired brain activity to a computer (Fig. S2). The participant underwent surgical implantation of the device  in  February  2019  and  had  no  complications.  The  procedure  lasted  approximately 3 hours. We began to collect data for this study in April 2019.

Real-Time Acquisition and Processing of Neural Data

A digital-signal  processing  system  (NeuroPort System,  Blackrock  Microsystems)  was  used  to acquire  signals  from  all  128  electrodes  of  the implant device and transmit them to a computer running  custom  software  for  real-time  signal analysis (Section S2 and Figs. S2 and S3). 18,23 As informed  by  previous  research  that  had  correlated neural activity in the 70 to 150 Hz (highgamma) frequency range with speech processing, 9,12-14,18 we  measured  activity  in  the  high-gamma band  for  each  channel  to  use  in  subsequent analyses and during real-time decoding.

Word and Sentence Task Design

The  study  consisted  of  50  sessions  over  the course of 81 weeks and took place at the participant's residence or a nearby office. The participant engaged in two types of tasks: an isolatedword task and a sentence task (Section S3 and Fig. S4). On average, we collected approximately 27 minutes of neural activity during these tasks at each session. In each trial of each task, a target word or sentence was presented visually to the participant as text on a screen, and then the participant attempted to produce (say aloud) that target.

In the isolated-word task, the participant attempted to produce individual words from a set of 50 English words. This word set contained common English words that can be used to create a variety of sentences, including words that are relevant to caregiving and words requested by the participant. In each trial, the participant was presented with one of these 50 words, and, after a 2-second delay, he attempted to produce that  word  when  the  text  of  the  word  on  the screen turned green. We collected 22 hours of data from 9800 trials of the isolated-word task performed by the participant in the first 48 of the 50 sessions.

In the sentence task, the participant attempted to produce word sequences from a set of 50 English sentences consisting of words from the 50-word set (Sections S4 and S5). In each trial, the participant was presented with a target sentence and attempted to produce the words in that sentence (in order) at the fastest speed he could perform comfortably. Throughout the trial, the word sequence decoded from neural activity was updated in real time and displayed as feedback to the participant. We collected data from 250 trials of the sentence task performed by the participant in 7 of the final 8 sessions. This task is shown in Video 2. A conversational variant of this task, in  which  the  participant  was  presented  with prompts and attempted to respond to them, is shown in Figure 1 and Video 1.

Figure 1 (facing page). Schematic Overview of the Direct Speech Brain-Computer Interface.

Shown is how neural activity acquired from an investigational electrocorticography electrode array implanted in a clinical study participant with severe paralysis is used to directly decode words and sentences in real time. In a conversational demonstration, the participant is visually prompted with a statement or question (A) and is instructed to attempt to respond using words from a predefined vocabulary set of 50 words. Simultaneously, cortical signals are acquired from the surface of the brain through the electrode array (B) and processed in real time (C). The processed neural signals are analyzed sample by sample with the use of a speechdetection model to detect the participant's attempts to speak (D). A classifier computes word probabilities (across the 50 possible words) from each detected window of relevant neural activity (E). A Viterbi decoding algorithm uses these probabilities in conjunction with word-sequence probabilities from a separately trained natural-language model to decode the most likely sentence given the neural activity data (F). The predicted sentence, which is updated each time a word is decoded, is displayed as feedback to the participant (G). Before real-time decoding, the models were trained with data collected as the participant attempted to say individual words from the 50-word set as part of a separate task (not depicted). This conversational demonstration is a variant of the standard sentence task used in this work, in that it allows the participant to compose his own unique responses to the prompts.

Modeling

We used neural activity data collected during the tasks to train, fine-tune, and evaluate custom models (Sections S6 and S7 and Table S1). Specifically, we created speech-detection and wordclassification  models  that  used  deep-learning techniques to make predictions from the neural activity. To decode sentences from the participant's  neural  activity  in  real  time  during  the sentence task, we also used a natural-language model and a Viterbi decoder (Fig. 1). The speechdetection  model  processed  each  time  point  of neural activity during a task and detected onsets and offsets of word-production attempts in real time  (Section  S8  and  Fig.  S5).  We  fitted  this model using neural activity data and task-timing information collected only during the isolatedword task.

For each attempt that was detected, the wordclassification  model  predicted  a  set  of  word probabilities  by  processing  the  neural  activity spanning  from  1  second  before  to  3  seconds after  the  detected  onset  of  attempted  speech

(Section S9 and Fig. S6). The predicted probability associated with each word in the 50-word set quantified how likely it was that the participant was attempting to say that word during the detected attempt. We fitted this model to neural data collected during the isolated-word task.

In  English,  certain  sequences  of  words  are more likely than others. To use this underlying linguistic  structure,  we  created  a  natural-language model that yielded next-word probabilities given the previous words in a sequence (Section S10). 24,25 We trained this model on a collection of sentences that included only words from the 50-word set; the sentences were obtained with the  use  of  a  custom  task  on  a  crowd-sourcing platform (Section S4).

The final component in the decoding approach involved  the  use  of  a  custom  Viterbi  decoder, which is a type of model that determines the most  likely  sequence  of  words  given  predicted word probabilities from the word classifier and word-sequence  probabilities  from  the  naturallanguage model (Section S11 and Fig. S7). 26 With the  incorporation  of  the  language  model,  the Viterbi  decoder  was  capable  of  decoding  more plausible sentences than what would result from simply  stringing  together  the  predicted  words from the word classifier.

Evaluations

To  evaluate  the  performance  of  our  decoding approach, we analyzed the sentences that were decoded in real time using two metrics: the word error rate and the number of words decoded per minute (Section S12). The word error rate of a decoded sentence was defined as the number of word errors made by the decoder divided by the number of words in the target sentence.

To  further  characterize  the  detection  and classification of word-production attempts from the participant's neural activity, we processed the collected isolated-word data with the speechdetection  and  word-classification  models  in off  line analyses performed after the recording sessions had been completed (Section S13). We measured  classification  accuracy  as  the  percentage of trials  in  which  the  word  classifier correctly  predicted  the  target  word  that  the participant attempted to produce. We also measured electrode contributions as the size of the effect that each individual electrode had on the

Figure 2 (facing page). Decoding a Variety of Sentences in Real Time through Neural Signal Processing and Language Modeling.

Panel A shows the word error rates, the numbers of words decoded per minute, and the decoded sentence lengths. The top plot shows the median word error rate (defined as the number of word errors made by the decoder divided by the number of words in the target sentence, with a lower rate indicating better performance) derived from the word sequences decoded from the participant's cortical activity during the performance of the sentence task. Data points represent sentence blocks (each block comprises 10 trials); the median rate, as indicated by the horizontal line within a box, is shown across 15 sentence blocks. The upper and lower sides of the box represent the interquartile range, and the   bars 1.5 times the interquartile range. Chance perI formance was measured by computing the word error rate on sentences randomly generated from the natural-language model. The middle plot shows the median number of words decoded per minute, as derived across all 150 trials (each data point represents a trial). The rates are shown for the analysis that included all words that were correctly or incorrectly decoded with the natural-language model and for the analysis that included only correctly decoded words. Each violin distribution was created with the use of kernel density estimation based on Scott's rule for computing the estimator bandwidth; the thick horizontal lines represent the median number of words decoded per minute, and the thinner horizontal lines the range (with the exclusion of outliers that were more than 4 standard deviations below or above the mean, which was the case for one trial). In the bottom chart, the decoded sentence lengths show whether the number of detected words was equal to the number of words in the target sentence in each of the 150 trials. Panel B shows the number of word errors in the sentences decoded with or without the natural-language model across all trials and all 50 sentence targets. Each small vertical dash represents the number of word errors in a single trial (there are 3 trials per target sentence; marks for identical error counts are staggered horizontally for visualization purposes). Each dot represents the mean number of errors for that target sentence across the 3 trials. The histogram at the bottom shows the error counts across all 150 trials. Panel C shows seven target sentence examples along with the corresponding sentences decoded with and without the natural-language model. Correctly decoded words are shown in black and incorrect words in red.

predictions made by the detection and classification models. 19,27

To investigate the viability of our approach for  a  long-term  application,  we  evaluated  the stability  of  the  acquired  cortical  signals  over time using the isolated-word data (Section S14). By sampling neural data from four different date ranges spanning the 81-week study period, we assessed  whether  classification  accuracy  on  a subset  of  data  collected  in  the  final  sessions could be improved by including data from earlier  subsets  as  part  of  the  training  set  for  the classification  model;  such  improvement  would indicate  that  training  data  accumulated  across months or years of recording could be used to reduce the need for frequent model recalibration in practical applications of our approach.

Statistical Analyses

Results for each experimental condition are presented with 95% confidence intervals when appropriate  (Section  S15).  No  adjustments  were made for multiple comparisons. The evaluation metrics (word error rate, number of words decoded per minute, and classification accuracy) were specified before the start of data collection. Analyses  to  assess  the  long-term  stability  of speech-detection and word-classification performance with  our  implant  device  were  designed post hoc.

Results

Sentence Decoding

During real-time sentence decoding, the median word error rate across 15 sentence blocks (each block comprised 10 trials) was 60.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 51.4 to 67.6) without language modeling and 25.6% (95% CI, 17.1 to 37.1) with language modeling (Fig. 2A, top). The lowest word error rate observed for a single sentence block was 7.0% (with language modeling). When chance performance was measured with the use of sentences that had been randomly generated by the natural-language model (Section S12), the median word error rate was 92.1% (95% CI, 85.7 to 97.2). Across all 150 trials, the median number of words decoded per minute was 15.2 with the inclusion of all decoded words and 12.5 with the  inclusion  of  only  correctly  decoded  words (with language modeling) (Fig. 2A, middle). In 92.0%  of  the  trials,  the  number  of  detected words was equal to the number of words in the target sentence (Fig. 2A, bottom). Across all 15 sentence blocks, five speech attempts were erroneously  detected  before  the  first  trial  in  the block and were excluded from real-time decoding  and  analysis  (all  other  detected  speech  attempts were included). For almost all target sentences, the mean number of word errors decreased

Figure 3 (facing page). Distinct Neural Activity Patterns during Word-Production Attempts.

Panel A shows the participant's brain reconstruction overlaid with the locations of the implanted electrodes and their contributions to the speech-detection and word-classification models. Plotted electrode size (area) and opacity are scaled by relative contribution (important electrodes appear larger and more opaque than other electrodes). Each set of contributions is normalized to sum to 1. For anatomical reference, the precentral gyrus is highlighted in light green. Panel B shows word confusion values computed with the use of the isolated-word data. For each target word (each row), the confusion value measures how often the word classifier predicted (regardless of whether the prediction was correct) each of the 50 possible words (each column) while the participant was attempting to say that target word. The confusion value is computed as a percentage relative to the total number of isolated-word trials for each target word, with the values in each row summing to 100%. Values along the diagonal correspond to correct classifications, and off-diagonal values correspond to incorrect classifications. The natural-language model was not used in this analysis.

when  the  natural-language  model  was  used (Fig. 2B), and in 80 of 150 trials with language modeling,  sentences  were  decoded  without  error.  Use  of  the  natural-language  model  during decoding  improved  performance  by  correcting grammatically and semantically implausible word sequences in the predictions (Fig. 2C). Real-time demonstrations are shown in Videos 1 and 2.

Word Detection and Classification

In the offline analyses that included data from 9000  attempts  to  produce  isolated  words  (and excluded the use of the natural-language model), the mean classification accuracy was 47.1% with the use of the speech detector and word classifier  to  predict  the  identity  of  the  target  word from cortical  activity.  The  accuracy  of  chance performance  (without  the  use  of  any  models) was 2%. Additional results of the isolated-word analyses  are  provided  in  Figures  S8  and  S9.  A total of 98% of these word-production attempts were  successfully  detected  (191  attempts  were not  detected),  and  968  detected  attempts  were spurious (not associated with a speech attempt) (Section S8). Electrodes in the most ventral aspect of the ventral sensorimotor cortex contributed  to  word-classification  performance  to  a greater extent than electrodes in the dorsal aspect of the ventral sensorimotor cortex, whereas the electrodes in the dorsal aspect contributed more to speech-detection performance (Fig. 3A). Classification  accuracy  was  consistent  across most of the target words (mean [±SD] classification  accuracy  across  the  50  target  words, 47.1±14.5%) (Fig. 3B).

Long-Term Stability of Acquired Cortical Signals

The long-term stability of the speech-related cortical activity patterns recorded during attempts to  produce  isolated  words  showed  that  the speech-detection and word-classification models performed consistently throughout the 81-week study period without daily or weekly recalibration (Fig. S10). When the models were used to analyze cortical activity recorded at the end of the study  period,  classification  accuracy  increased when the data set used to train the classification models contained data recorded throughout the study period, including data recorded more than a year before the collection of the data used to test the models (Fig. 4).

Discussion

We showed that high-density recordings of cortical activity in the speech-production area of the sensorimotor  cortex  of  an  anarthric  and  paralyzed person can be used to decode full words and  sentences  in  real  time.  Our  deep-learning models were able to use the participant's neural activity  to  detect  and  classify  his  attempts  to produce words from a 50-word set, and we could use these models, together with language-modeling techniques, to decode a variety of meaningful sentences. Our models, enabled by the longterm stability of recordings from the implanted device, could use data accumulated throughout the  81-week  study  period  to  improve  decoding performance when evaluating data recorded near the end of the study.

Previous  demonstrations  of  word  and  sentence decoding from cortical neural activity have been  conducted  with  participants  who  could speak without the need for assistive technology to  communicate. 15-19 Similar  to  the  problem  of decoding intended movements in someone who is paralyzed, the lack of precise time alignment between  intended  speech  and  neural  activity poses  a  challenge  during  model  training.  We addressed  this  time-alignment  problem  with

Figure 4. Signal Stability and Long-Term Accumulation of Training Data to Improve Decoder Performance.

Each bar depicts the mean classification accuracy (the percentage of trials in which the target word was correctly predicted) from isolated-word data sampled from the final weeks of the study period (weeks 79 through 81) fter speech-detection and word-classification models were trained on difa ferent samples of the isolated-word data from various week ranges. Each result was computed with the use of a 10-fold cross-validation evaluation approach. In this approach, the available data were partitioned into 10 equally sized, nonoverlapping subsets. In the first cross-validation 'fold,' one of these data subsets is used as the testing set, and the remaining 9 are used for model training. This was repeated 9 more times until each subset was used for testing (after training on the other subsets). This approach ensures that models were never evaluated on the data used during training (Sections S6 and S14).   bars indicate the 95% confidence interval of the mean, each I computed across the 10 cross-validation folds. The data quantities specify the average amount of data used to train the word-classification models across cross-validation folds. Week 0 denotes the first week during which data for this study was collected, which occurred 9 weeks after surgical implantation of the study device. Accuracy of chance performance was calculated as 1 divided by the number of possible words and is indicated by a horizontal dashed line.

speech-detection approaches 18,28,29 and word classifiers  that  used  machine-learning  techniques, such as model ensembling and data augmentation  (Section  S9),  to  increase  reliability  of  the model to minor temporal variabilities in recorded signals. 30,31 Decoding performance was largely driven by neural-activity patterns in the ventral sensorimotor  cortex,  a  finding  consistent  with previous  work  implicating  this  area  in  speech production. 9,12,13 This  finding  may  inform  electrode placement in future studies. We were also able to show the preservation of functional cortical representations of speech in a person who had  had  anarthria  for  more  than  15  years,  a finding analogous to previous findings of limbrelated cortical sensorimotor representations in tetraplegic persons years after the loss of limb movement. 32,33

The incorporation of language-modeling techniques in this study reduced the median word error rate by 35 percentage points and enabled perfect decoding in more than half the sentence trials. This improvement was facilitated through the  use  of  all  of  the  probabilistic  information provided by the word classifier during decoding and by allowing the decoder to update previously predicted words each time a new word was decoded. These results show the benefit of integrating  linguistic  information  when  decoding speech from neural recordings. Speech-decoding approaches generally become usable at word error rates below 30%, 34 which suggests that our approach may be applicable in other clinical settings.

In previously reported brain-computer interface applications, decoding models often require daily  recalibration  before  deployment  with  a user, 6,35 which can increase the variability of decoder performance across days and impede longterm  adoption  of  the  interface  for  real-world use. 35,36 Because  of  the  relatively  high  signal stability of electrocorticographic recordings, 5,37-39 we could accumulate cortical activity acquired by the  implanted  electrodes  across  months  of  recording to train our decoding models. Overall, decoding  performance  was  maintained  or  improved by the accumulation of large quantities of training data over time without daily recalibration, which suggests that high-density electrocorticography may be suitable for long-term direct-speech neuroprosthetic applications.
