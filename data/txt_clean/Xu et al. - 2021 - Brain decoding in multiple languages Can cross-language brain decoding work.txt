The approach of cross-language brain decoding is to use models of brain decoding from one language to decode stimuli of another language. It has the potential to provide new insights into how our brain represents multiple languages. While it is possible to decode semantic information across different languages from neuroimaging data, the approach s overall success remains to be tested and depends on a number of factors such as cross-' language similarity, age of acquisition/proficiency levels, and depth of language processing. We expect to see continued progress in this domain, from a traditional focus on words and concrete concepts toward the use of naturalistic  experimental  tasks  involving  higher-level  language  processing  (e.g.,  discourse  processing).  The approach can also be applied to understand how cross-modal, cross-cultural, and other nonlinguistic factors may influence neural representations of different languages. This article provides an overview of cross-language brain decoding with suggestions for future research directions.

1. Introduction

Decoding language from neural activity has become an exciting and challenging research topic, in large part due to the rapid advances in artificial  intelligence,  and  in  brain-inspired  computing,  that  is,  using what is known about the brain for the design of novel computing systems (Anumanchipalli,  Chartier, &amp; Chang,  2019;  Poldrack,  2011).  'Brain decoding of language , as a relatively new field of research, refers to the ' following approach of study (see Fig. 1 for illustration): neural responses to linguistic materials are recorded with neuroimaging methods, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and magnetoencephalography (MEG); a computational model is trained to map between brain activity and stimulus-specific linguistic features; if the model successfully predicts new linguistic stimuli from brain activity, it means that the model captures important semantic-conceptual features of the stimuli, thereby achieving the purpose of decoding the language stimuli. The dimensions needed to capture the semantic features of the stimuli (i.e., the semantic space) may be postulated by researchers or derived from text corpora which can be based on statistical regularities inherent in the text (e.g., word co-occurrences). Many factors determine the accuracy of brain decoding, including the temporal and spatial resolutions in the neuroimaging recordings and the type and nature of the computational model (Gallant, 2016). The approach of brain decoding of language not only helps us to understand how the brain represents language, but also has  important  clinical  and  educational  implications.  For  example,  it could be used to predict what words a person is hearing, reading or even thinking,  which,  in  the  future,  could  inform  the  design  of  braincomputer  interfaces.  The  proper  development  of  such  interfaces  can make a huge difference in people s lives, especially for those who suffer ' from communication disorders, including aphasia due to stroke or other neurodegenerative diseases.

A landmark study of brain decoding of language was conducted by Mitchell et al. (2008), which showed that it was possible to accurately predict which concrete concepts (e.g., celery) a participant was thinking of by analyzing the corresponding brain activations in response to the concepts (e.g., a picture of celery). The predictions were made based on a  linear  regression  model  that  was  trained  to  establish  the  mapping between the intermediate semantic features of the input nouns and the corresponding brain activation elicited by the nouns. The intermediate semantic features that were used to encodes the meaning of the nouns were defined by 25 verbs, such as eat, taste, smell, hear, see, touch and so on, and the feature values (the co-occurrence of the semantic features

and the stimulus words) were obtained from a very large corpus of text. The  brain  activations  were  recorded  with  fMRI  while  participants watched repeated images presented in the scanner. The model, with above-chance accuracy, not only reliably predicted the brain activation elicited by novel nouns but also decoded the nouns from a new dataset based on brain activation.

2. Cross-language brain decoding at the word level

2.1. Approaches and findings

An exciting new direction in recent years has been cross-language brain  decoding,  which  is  our  focus  here.  This  direction  of  research helps us to reveal how our brain represents multiple languages. Traditional neuroimaging studies of bilingualism have compared neural activities elicited by different languages, and identified both common and distinct neural systems of multiple languages (see Li, 2009, for a discussion). The cross-language brain decoding approach provides a new and powerful direction to address the issue of how two or more languages are encoded through shared and distinct neural activities in the brain. These studies have significant practical implications for bilingual education and foreign language instruction. For example, the study of different  ages of acquisition or proficiency levels of second language learners would allow us to disentangle whether and how much the linguistic background and experience might influence the success of crosslanguage  decoding  in  the  bilingual  brain,  which  could  potentially inform us about mechanisms underlying critical periods for language acquisition.  However,  so  far  it  is  unclear  whether  and  how  crosslanguage  brain  decoding  works,  given  the  extant  evidence.  Simply put, can we use models of brain decoding from language A and apply them successfully to decode language B, and vice versa? In this article, we provide a review of recent studies of brain decoding in different languages in an attempt to identify the various factors that may affect the success of cross-language decoding. We will focus on cross-language decoding at the word level, discuss sentence- and passage-level decoding, and conclude with a discussion of future directions.

A number of recent studies have demonstrated that it is possible to reliably decode semantic information at the word level across different languages  from  neuroimaging  data  using  machine  learning  methods. The general approach is to first train a decoder to learn the mappings between stimuli in language A (e.g., English) and the corresponding brain activity elicited by the stimuli. Then, if the decoder is successful for language A, it is tested on a new set of data, this time the brain activity evoked by stimuli from a new language, language B (e.g., Chinese) (Fig. 2). Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) has been used in crosslanguage decoding with increasing popularity (Haxby, 2012). Compared to the traditional univariate method which examines brain voxels in isolation, MVPA takes into account the relationships across multiple voxels and has the potential to decode fine-grained patterns of brain activity. Table 1 presents a summary of the cross-language brain decoding studies that vary in the use of participants, materials, tasks, and data analytic methods (most of which had used MVPA). Variations along each of these dimensions could affect the predictive accuracy in the studies. In what follows, we take a detailed examination of these studies.

Bilinguals  are  usually  recruited  as  participants  in  cross-language brain decoding studies and the same participants need to receive stimuli (words) from both languages (consecutively) while their brain responses are collected during the processing of these stimuli. Buchweitz, Shinkareva, Mason, Mitchell, and Just (2012) used concrete nouns from two categories (tools and dwellings) as stimuli and presented the nouns in  Portuguese  and  English  (translation  equivalents)  consecutively  to Portuguese-English bilinguals. Participants were required to read each noun silently and think about the properties of the noun while their brain activity was recorded using fMRI. Results showed that, when the decoder was trained on the fMRI signals elicited by the English nouns and tested on the fMRI activity elicited by the Portuguese nouns, the decoding  accuracy  reached  0.68.  Likewise,  when  the  decoder  was

Fig. 1. General approach for brain decoding  of  language.  Brain  activation of  linguistic  stimuli  can  be  recorded when  participants  perform  a  language task in the scanner. Vector-based, highdimensional  representations  of  the  linguistic  stimuli  can  be  derived  from  a large text corpus. A decoder is trained to map the semantic vectors of the stimuli and the corresponding brain activation. The  decoder  can  then  be  applied  to predict what brain activation may result given a stimulus, or predict which of the stimulus  it  is  given  the  specific  brain activation patterns.

trained with the Portuguese nouns and tested on the brain activity elicited by the English nouns, the decoding accuracy reached 0.72. Both were significantly higher than the chance level (i.e., 0.5). The authors suggested that the representation of the meanings of the same nouns may share the same neural substrates between English and Portuguese.

Subsequent  research  further  confirmed  the  feasibility  of  crosslanguage brain decoding at the word level. Correia et al. (2014) examined the decoding of spoken words between Dutch and English. DutchEnglish  bilinguals  were  asked  to  listen  to  animate  and  inanimate nouns and press a button when they heard the inanimate nouns in the MRI scanner. The detection accuracy was 97.5%, indicating that participants  knew  the  words  in  both  languages.  MVPA  revealed  several regions responsible for the cross-language word discrimination, including the anterior temporal lobe. Their follow-up study (Correia, Jansma, Hausfeld, Kikkert, &amp; Bonte, 2015) measured EEG signals to identify  the  time  course  of  Dutch-English  cross-language  decoding. Although  within-language  decoding  might  have  taken  place  around 50 620 ms after the word onset, cross-language decoding occurred later, -around 550 600 ms after the word onset. According to the authors, this -broad timeline for within-language decoding and narrow time window for cross-language decoding could be explained by the different mechanisms  underlying  decoding:  within-language  decoding  relies  on  the initial phonetic-phonological processing and the subsequent lexical semantic processing, whereas cross-language decoding could rely on the shared  semantic-conceptual  properties  of  the  word  across  languages, therefore occurring within a narrow but fast time window.

Cross-language decoding success in bilinguals reported in the above studies  reflects  the  common  neural representation  of word meanings across two languages. However, since the participants recruited in these studies  were  proficient  bilinguals  who  know  the  words  in  both  languages very well, it is likely that cross-language decoding reflects the association  of  translation  equivalents  in  bilinguals  rather  than  true similarities in the neural substrates of representation. This hypothesis is especially plausible given the Correia et al. (2015) finding that the crosslanguage decoding time window is significantly shorter than the withinlanguage decoding time window. In contrast to the use of bilinguals, Zinszer, Anderson, Kang, Wheatley, and Raizada (2015) and Zinszer, Anderson,  Kang,  Wheatley,  and  Raizada  (2016)  tested  only  monolinguals  so  that  the  Chinese-speaking  participants  read  only  Chinese words (e.g., 'fu ' 斧 ) and English-speaking participants read only English words (e.g., 'axe ). They were asked to determine whether the word was ' semantically related to the preceding word in the MRI scanner. Neural similarity matrices were calculated for each participant based on activation patterns in their own language. Surprisingly, neural similarity matrices for English and Chinese were strongly correlated ( r = 0.89, p &lt; 0.001), thus allowing accurate cross-language decoding. For some brain regions  the  decoding  accuracy  reached  100%  (Zinszer  et  al.,  2015), including the anterior parahippocampal and postcentral gyrus in the left hemisphere  and  the  frontal  orbital  cortex,  anterior  cingulate  gyrus, anterior supramarginal gyrus and posterior inferior temporal gyrus in the right hemisphere. However, this study tested only seven ChineseEnglish  words  (translation  equivalents)  referring  to  concrete  objects, and therefore its generalizability remains unclear.

2.2. Applications to other domains

The  cross-language  brain  decoding  approach  has  not  only  been applied to data from language comprehension (in which participants

listened or read the stimulus words) as reported above, but also from language  production  (in  which  participants  named  the  stimuli).  For example, Van de Putte, De Baene, Brass, and Duyck (2017) asked DutchFrench bilinguals to name pictures of 10 concepts in Dutch and French consecutively. The order of presenting the two languages was counterbalanced  across  participants.  Two  different  images  were  selected  to represent each concept and each image was associated with one language in order to exclude the influence of visual similarity. For example, a moon was represented by a crescent moon in the Dutch naming blocks (e.g., 10 concepts to be named in Dutch) and a full moon in the French naming blocks. Their data indicated above-chance level accuracy for cross-language decoding in the left inferior and middle temporal gyrus and the bilateral occipitotemporal cortex, suggesting shared semantic representations of L1 and L2 word production in these regions. However,  this  study  didn t  find  the  involvement  of  frontal  regions  and ' anterior temporal regions, in contrast to the role of these regions for cross-language decoding in studies that have used comprehension tasks (Buchweitz et al., 2012; Correia et al., 2014). Such discrepancies may suggest different neural representations associated with production and comprehension, which affect accuracy of cross-language decoding.

In the same spirit as brain decoding across languages, brain decoding has also been applied to different modalities. For example, Van de Putte, De Baene, Price, and Duyck (2018) investigated the decoding across visual and auditory modalities, in which Dutch-French bilinguals were instructed  to  complete  three  different  tasks  in  Dutch  and  French consecutively. In essence, this is both cross-modality and cross-language decoding. The picture naming task was the same as that used in the above-mentioned study of Van de Putte et al. (2017),  and  the  word reading task (visual) and word-listening task (auditory) required participants to make a judgement about the properties of the concept (e.g., whether the concept was bigger or smaller than a football). Significant cross-language predictions were observed in the rolandic operculum and some motor-related areas (pre- and post-central, the cerebellum) in both word reading and listening tasks. More interestingly, it was possible to identify the picture the participant was naming (auditory) in one language based on the brain activation elicited by the reading of the corresponding word (visual) in the other language, and vice versa. The cross-modality decoding effect was most pronounced in the left lingual gyrus,  suggesting  its  critical  role  in  language-independent  semantic processing.  This  result  suggested  the  existence  of  both  modalityindependent and modality-dependent semantic representation, but the specific  brain  regions  that  support  language-independent  semantic processing may vary. According to the 'hub-and-spoke ' model (Ralph, Jefferies, Patterson, &amp; Rogers, 2017), modality-specific and modalityindependent representations are realized in different neural circuits, in visual/auditory/motor  areas  versus  anterior  temporal  lobe,  respectively. The left lingual gyrus could be part of the modality-independent neural network responsible for visual and motoric information processing.

Another potentially exciting domain of application of cross-language decoding is sign language (SL) vs. spoken language decoding, although there has been limited work so far on this topic. Despite the clear differences in input/output modes, the neural substrates of SL and spoken language appear to both involve a predominantly left-lateralized brain network  as  revealed  by  lesion  and  neuroimaging  studies  (Emmorey, Giezen, &amp; Gollan, 2016; Macsweeney, Capek, Campbell, &amp; Woll, 2008). By  examining  cross-language  decoding  between  SL  and  spoken  language, we can determine (a) the extent to which the neural representations of language are dependent on (or independent of) the modality, and  (b)  if  and  how  differences  can  arise  due  to  modality-specific representations.  Comparison  between  this  new  line  of  research  with extant work from unimodal bilinguals could offer a unique opportunity to understand the nature of cross-modality conceptual representation.

3. What factors affect cross-language decoding success?

The above review suggests that cross-language brain decoding is a promising approach to understand how multiple languages are encoded in  the  human  brain.  However,  the  decoding  accuracy  varies  across studies, and is affected by many factors. In what follows, we provide a synthesis of the potential factors that may underlie the degree of success in this approach.

3.1. Cross-language similarity

One factor that affects cross-language decoding is the distance or similarity between the two languages, which may involve systematic differences  in  vocabulary,  grammar,  phonology,  script,  and  other characteristics. For instance, English and Chinese are distant in terms of both spoken and written forms (Li, Tan, Bates, &amp; Tzeng, 2006). Chinese is a tonal language in which different pitches and duration of the sound convey different meanings of words, and is a non-inflectional language that relies heavily on contextual semantics. By contrast, English is a nontonal language, and uses inflectional morphemes to assign grammatical properties to words (e.g., tense morphology).

Understanding the extent to which there are shared or different aspects across languages is an essential step in addressing the possible influences  of  language  properties  and  linguistic  experience  on  crosslanguage brain decoding. One well-studied example of crosslinguistic differences would be linguistic categories, including lexical categories and grammatical categories (e.g., Malt &amp; Majid, 2013; Pavlenko, 2009). There are many cases in which the structure or boundaries of lexical categories  do  not  neatly  match  across  languages,  even  for  concrete nouns referring to common objects whose appearances and functions are expected to be generally the same in different languages. For instance, clear  cross-language  differences  have  been  shown  in  the  naming  of common household  items  (such  as  cups,  dishes,  bottles  and  jars)  in speakers of English, Chinese, and Spanish (Malt, Sloman, Gennari, Shi, &amp; Wang, 1999; Malt, Sloman, &amp; Gennari, 2003) and French and Dutch (Ameel,  Storms,  Malt, &amp; Sloman,  2005).  Such  differences  also  have direct influences on bilingual speakers ' naming performance, as shown in  both  behavioral studies and computational models (Fang, Zinszer, Malt, &amp; Li, 2016; Malt, Jobe, Li, Pavlenko, &amp; Ameel, 2016; Malt, Li, Pavlenko, Zhu, &amp; Ameel, 2015). Besides, in the classic case of color terms, languages can differ in the size of color vocabularies in that some languages have a relatively larger set of color items that divide the color spectrum more finely than other languages. The English category blue, for example, is lexically differentiated by Russian and Greek speakers using different terms to describe dark blue and light blue (Athanasopoulos, 2009; Pavlenko, 2009).

With respect to grammatical categories like nouns and verbs, the distinction between noun and verb classes is transparent in some languages (such as German), but it could be ambiguous in other languages because of the lack of inflectional morphology (e.g., no conjugation for verbs and no declension for nouns in Chinese; Li, Jin, &amp; Tan, 2004). Studies of crosslinguistic comparisons of early lexical development have also indicated patterns of distinct noun -verb acquisition as a function of the specific types of language. For example, many studies report that there is a preponderance of nouns compared to other categories of words in English-speaking children s early lexicon (Gentner, 1982; Bates et al., '

GLYPH&lt;0&gt;GLYPH&lt;11&gt;GLYPH&lt;0&gt;GLYPH&lt;21&gt;GLYPH&lt;0&gt;

M. Xu et al.

1994), but there is no clear evidence of this noun bias in several Asian languages such as Chinese and Korean (Choi, 2000; Hao et al., 2015; Tardif, 1996, 2006; Xuan &amp; Dollaghan, 2013).

Diversity of linguistic categories may be influenced by sociocultural factors (Malt &amp; Majid, 2013) and emerge dynamically from the interaction between the learner and the learning environment (Elman, 2004; Li,  2009).  The  crosslinguistic  differences  in  lexical  and  grammatical categories result in an absence of complete conceptual equivalence in the lexical vocabularies of different languages (Pavlenko, 2009). The degree to which a particular lexical concept varies across languages may result in different representations in the brain, which in turn may affect the success of cross-language brain decoding. Take grammatical categories for example. Previous studies have demonstrated that nouns and verbs  are  represented  and  processed  in  separate  brain  regions,  with nouns engaging the temporal cortex more strongly and verbs the prefrontal areas more extensively (Shapiro &amp; Caramazza, 2003; Vigliocco, Vinson, Druks, Barber, &amp; Cappa, 2011). However, in languages where the  distinction  between  nouns  and  verbs  is  less  clear  grammatically (such as Chinese), they do not evoke distinct cortical activity as in English  or  other  Indo-European  languages  (Li  et  al.,  2004).  Therefore, cross-linguistic differences in how grammatical class is expressed may affect  cross-language  brain  decoding,  particularly  for  decoding  those words that are class-ambiguous in one language but not in the other language.

Some  previous  research  has  examined  the  influence  of  crosslanguage similarity on the neural representation by directly comparing between languages (Chan et al., 2008; Jeong et al., 2007; Kim et al.,  2016;  Tolentino &amp; Tokowicz, 2011). Differences in brain activation of L1 and L2 were observed as a function of cross-language similarity  in  terms  of  word  order  (Jeong  et  al.,  2007)  and  orthographic transparency (Kim et al., 2016). For example, Jeong et al. found that, in native Korean speakers who had learned two L2s (English and Japanese), there was greater neural similarity in the left inferior frontal gyrus,  right  superior  temporal  cortex  and  right  cerebellum  between Korean vs. Japanese sentence processing in comparison to Korean vs. English sentence processing. The results were interpreted as an effect of word-order  similarity  (e.g.,  Subject -Object -Verb in  both  Korean  and Japanese as opposed to Subject -Verb Object in English). In Kim et al. s -' fMRI study (2016), Korean-Chinese-English trilinguals were tested using a  word  rhyming  judgment  task  that  tapped  into  the  orthographyphonology  mapping  process.  The  distance  of  orthographic  transparency was smaller between English and Korean than between Chinese and  Korean.  Results  showed  that  Korean  word  processing  activated largely overlapping brain areas as English word processing, whereas it led to substantial differential activations in bilateral frontal and temporal cortical areas as compared with Chinese word processing. A more recent study by Xu, Baldauf, Chang, Desimone, and Tan (2017) showed that  despite  overall  overlapping  brain  activation,  MVPA  indicated distinct fine-grained patterns of neural representation between Chinese and English word processing. Therefore, it is important for future studies to  take  into  consideration  the  degree  of  (dis)similarity  between  languages and examine what aspects of language properties may influence the success of cross-language brain decoding.

3.2. Age of acquisition (AoA) and proficiency

AoA and proficiency of the second language have been found to be among the most important variables underlying the neural representation  of  L1  and  L2  in  the  bilingual  brain  (see  Hernandez &amp; Li,  2007; Perani &amp; Abutalebi,  2005  for  reviews).  A  recent  meta-analysis  by Cargnelutti, Tomasino, and Fabbro (2019) summarized 57 publications with regard to the brain activation patterns of L1 and L2 using activation likelihood  estimation  (ALE).  They  used  age  6  as  the  AoA  cutoff  and found that late bilinguals (i.e., after age 6) consistently recruited more neural  resources  in  the  left  inferior  frontal  gyrus  and  the  posteriormedial  frontal  gyrus  for  processing  L2  than  processing  L1,  whereas this difference was not significant in early bilinguals (i.e., before age 6). The authors attributed the late bilinguals ' additional neural activation in the prefrontal cortex to more effortful executive function required for processing in the L2. On the other hand, there is also evidence showing that  earlier  L2  AoA  was  associated  with  greater  neural  dissimilarity between L1 and L2. A recent study by Ou, Li, Yang, Wang, and Xu (2020) used representational similarity analysis (RSA) to quantify the degree of neural similarity between L1 and L2 processing. It was found that earlier AoA was associated with higher pattern dissimilarity between L1 and L2 in the left inferior gyrus and middle frontal gyrus. This AoA effect may be  due  to  earlier  bilinguals ' greater  neural  plasticity  in  promoting language-specific  neural  computations  for  different  languages,  especially  when  learning  two  distant  languages.  This  explanation  was consistent with another recent study that used quantitative MRI (qMRI) in combination with fMRI techniques (Luo et al., 2019), in which early L2 AoA was associated with enhanced microstructural proliferation in Chinese-English bilinguals.

Many studies have shown that L2 proficiency is an equally important factor (see Hernandez &amp; Li, 2007; Li, 2013 for reviews). In another metaanalysis using ALE, Sebastian, Laird, and Kiran (2011) focused on the neural activation modulated by L2 proficiency. They found that highproficiency bilinguals showed more similarity in L1 and L2 brain representations compared to moderate/low-proficiency bilinguals, particularly in the left superior frontal gyrus and left middle temporal gyrus. Yang and Li (2019) also showed that the connectivity patterns in late L2 learners ' brain network are moderated by L2 proficiency, among other abilities such as auditory pitch processing. There has also been recent work to identify the independent contributions of AoA vs. proficiency to neural  representations  and  brain  structures  (see  Nichols &amp; Joanisse, 2016 for example), as well as convergent multimodal imaging evidence from resting-state, functional, and structural MRI investigations (Wang et al., 2020).

In Sheikh, Carreiras, and Soto (2019a) study, the influences of both AoA and L2 proficiency on cross-language decoding were examined. Although all participants were early bilinguals, their AoA of Spanish was earlier than that of Basque and they were also more proficient in Spanish than  in  Basque.  It  was  hypothesized  that  more  balanced  bilinguals would exhibit increased cross-language decoding accuracy. They performed correlational analyses between cross-language decoding accuracy and the proficiency levels in Basque vs. Spanish (using proficiency difference scores). Results showed a tendency that the smaller the difference in proficiency between the bilingual s two languages, the greater ' the brain decoding accuracy in the left lateral temporal lobe, inferior frontal gyrus and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. However, the authors noted that the results should be taken with caution because the study was not designed to explore inter-individual differences and that the results did not survive multiple comparison corrections.

3.3. Depth of language processing

Brain decoding within and across languages depends on the quality of the neuroimaging data obtained, which is in turn dependent on the participant s level of processing of the language stimuli. It is well known ' from classic memory theories that deeper, more elaborative, and richer semantic processing would lead to better memory (e.g., more successful retrieval) than shallow or surface-level processing of the same material (e.g., Craik &amp; Lockhart, 1972). Some researchers propose that depth of processing during the processing task plays a critical role in the generalizability of semantic representations across languages.

Sheikh et al. (2019a) tested the role of depth of processing in early and proficient Spanish-Basque bilinguals, who were asked to perform shallow or deep semantic processing tasks. In the shallow processing task,  the  participants  were  asked  to  read  and  attend  to  the  word, whereas in the deep processing task, the participants were asked to think about the characteristics of the living/non-living object it represented (e.g., shape, color). MVPA  analyses  showed  that  cross-language

GLYPH&lt;0&gt;GLYPH&lt;11&gt;GLYPH&lt;0&gt;GLYPH&lt;21&gt;GLYPH&lt;0&gt;

M. Xu et al.

GLYPH&lt;0&gt;GLYPH&lt;21&gt;GLYPH&lt;0&gt;GLYPH&lt;20&gt;GLYPH&lt;0&gt;GLYPH&lt;24&gt;

decoding of concepts was significant only in the context of deeper levels of processing, whereas the decoding of the word category within language was significant regardless of the level of depth of processing. This pattern of results indicates that deeper semantic processing (and the resulting  brain  patterns)  is  a  necessary  condition  for  cross-language decoding to be successful. The same researchers (Sheikh, Carreiras, &amp; Soto,  2019b)  further  conducted  a  study  to  examine  the  influence  of awareness of words on language decoding. Words were visually presented to Spanish-Basque bilinguals briefly with masks such that participants could not be consciously aware of the word. Participants were instructed to determine whether the word was animate or inanimate and rate how conscious they were about the word (e.g., 'didn t see anything ' ' or 'saw the word clearly ). It was shown that fully or partially conscious ' conditions elicited above-chance decoding accuracy in more regions of interest (ROIs) than non-conscious conditions: when participants were unaware of the specific words due to rapid presentation and masking, above-chance decoding was found in limited regions for both Spanish and Basque; when participants were partially aware or fully conscious about  the  words,  all  ROIs  showed  above-chance  within-language decoding accuracy. Further, their findings suggested that brain decoding across languages requires not only a deeper language processing but also conscious perception of language stimuli.

Given that depth of processing can significantly impact both crosslanguage  and  within-language  decoding,  many  previous  studies,  in order  to  engage  participants  in  deep  processing,  have  presented  the same  word  stimuli  for  multiple  times  during  brain  imaging  (e.g., Buchweitz et al., 2012; Correia et al., 2014, 2015; Mitchell et al., 2008; Van de Putte et al., 2017, 2018; Zinszer et al., 2015). For example, in Mitchell et al. s classic study, the participants viewed the same word/ ' picture six times and their task was to think about the properties of the objects/concepts to which the stimuli refer when the stimuli were presented. The results could have been different if the stimuli were presented only one time, leading to shallow processing. Moreover, L1 and L2 words can differ in the processes and contexts within which learning takes place, which may influence the depth of processing in different languages. During L1 learning, children build direct relations between the words and the objects/concepts by integrating the perceptual and sensorimotor experiences from the environment, interacting with the objects  and  people  and  performing  actions  in  it,  whereas  during  L2 learning, the learners typically associate the words to an existing label in their native language (see Li &amp; Jeong, 2020 for a review). The lack of embodied  and  social  interaction  during  L2  learning  may  lead  to  a shallower and less elaborative processing of L2 words relative to L1, which may in turn affect the success of cross-language brain decoding in L2 vs. L1 stimuli (Jeong, Li, Suzuki, Kawashima, &amp; Sugiura, 2020).

4. Beyond words: Sentence- and discourse-level decoding

So  far,  the  cross-language  decoding  approach  has  been  applied mostly to the word/concept level, as reviewed above. A few studies, with limited success, have extended the approach to the sentence and discourse levels. Yang, Wang, Bailer, Cherkassky, and Just (2017a) hypothesized that given the common neural substrates between languages, it  is  possible  that  the  English-based  model  could  also  be  applied  to decode sentences in other languages. Therefore, the authors used the parameters from the English-based model of Wang, Cherkassky, and Just (2017), including brain locations associated with semantic dimensions, semantic features/thematic roles and trained model weights, to decode the Portuguese sentences that were translated from English (in Wang et al. s study, each word in a sentence was encoded based on 42 semantic ' features,  e.g.,  color/size/animacy,  and  6  thematic  roles,  e.g.,  agent/ patient/predicate).  Both  Portuguese  monolinguals  and  PortugueseEnglish  bilinguals  were  recruited  to  read  the  translated  sentences  in Portuguese.  The  decoding  accuracy  of  the  English-based  model  on Portuguese  sentences  was  significantly  above  chance.  Yang  et  al. s ' findings also showed that the cross-language decoding accuracy did not vary as a function of whether the participants were monolinguals or bilinguals (0.67 for Portuguese monolinguals versus 0.66 for Portuguese-English bilinguals), suggesting that knowing English did not facilitate the decoding accuracy of Portuguese even though the decoding model was based on English language stimuli.

Yang, Wang, Bailer, Cherkassky, and Just (2017b) further extended their cross-language decoding across two languages to the decoding of sentences across three languages, i.e., English, Portuguese, and Chinese. Stimuli included sentences written in English, Portuguese and Chinese. English  monolinguals,  Portuguese  monolinguals,  Portuguese-English bilinguals and Mandarin-English bilinguals were asked to read sentences  referring  to  both  concrete  and  abstract  concepts  in  their  native language and think about the meanings of the sentences while in the scanner. The decoder was trained to map between sentences and the corresponding activations either in one language or in two languages (e. g., English and Chinese, English and Portuguese). The decoder trained on  two  languages  (0.668  averaged  across  three  language  pairs)  was more accurate when applied to the third language than the decoder trained on one language and then applied to either of the remaining languages (0.624 averaged across six one-to-one language pairs), and this advantage  was  especially  pronounced  with  abstract  concepts including social interactions and mental activity.

Yang et al. (2017b) used RSA to show that the similarity of neural representation  of  sentences  between  English  and  Portuguese  was slightly  higher  than  that  between  Portuguese  and Chinese. This may suggest that the neural semantic space was more similar between similar languages (e.g., Portuguese and English) than between distant language (e.g.,  Portuguese  and  Chinese;  see  3.1  on  the  role  of  cross-language similarity). However, the pairwise language decoding accuracy among the three languages did not differ significantly (e.g., decoding accuracy from English to Portuguese and from Chinese to Portuguese was 0.63 and 0.60, respectively). It is important to note that that the sample size of  Yang  et  al. s  study  was  small  (based  on  7  participants  from  each ' language group) and the language experiences of the participants were not matched (e.g., all Chinese participants and 3 Portuguese participants were bilingual and the remainder were monolingual). These discrepancies may affect the decoding results and limit the generalization of their findings with regard to how language similarity may affect brain representations and decoding successes across languages.

Given the encouraging findings from brain decoding of words and sentences,  researchers  recently  have  also  been  interested  in  how discourse-level  narrative  stories  are  represented  in  the  brain  and whether cross-language brain decoding of narratives is possible. Dehghani et al. (2017) recruited English monolinguals, Chinese-English bilinguals, and Farsi-English bilinguals to perform in-scanner reading of translations of the same 40 stories in their native language (English, Chinese, Farsi, respectively). The 40 stories were chosen from an English corpus of over 20 million weblog story posts and were translated into Mandarin Chinese and Farsi. Doc2vec (Le &amp; Mikolov, 2014) was used to model narrative-level semantic representations of the stimulus stories using a large weblog corpus for each language separately, and each of the stories in each language was represented as a 100-dimension semantic  vector.  Their  result  demonstrated  that  which  specific  story  a participant was reading could be decoded using the fMRI signals from reading of these stories. Moreover, this decoding was successful even when the decoder based on a different language was applied to predict the story of the language the participant was reading. For example, the decoding accuracy of Chinese story was 0.55 when using the decoder of Farsi stories. The cross-language decoding accuracy was 0.564 averaged across  all  six  language  pairs.  Searchlight-based  MVPA  indicated  that informative  clusters  for  cross-language  and  within-language  story decoding  were  similar,  mainly  located  in  the  default  mode  network including the posterior medial cortices, the medial prefrontal cortex, and the lateral parietal cortex. Although Dehghani et al. s study pro-' vided initial evidence that cross-language decoding of narrative stories is  possible,  the  accuracy  remained  quite  low  (0.564  on  average),  as

GLYPH&lt;0&gt;GLYPH&lt;11&gt;GLYPH&lt;0&gt;GLYPH&lt;21&gt;GLYPH&lt;0&gt;

M. Xu et al.

GLYPH&lt;0&gt;GLYPH&lt;21&gt;GLYPH&lt;0&gt;GLYPH&lt;20&gt;GLYPH&lt;0&gt;GLYPH&lt;24&gt;

compared with the accuracy seen with word or sentence-level decoding (typically in the 0.60-0.70 range). More work is needed in the future to examine  discourse-level  brain  decoding  across  as  well  as  within languages.

5. General discussion and future directions

5.1. Brain decoding in bilinguals vs. monolinguals

Most  of  the  previous  studies  of  cross-language  decoding  have recruited bilingual speakers so as to decode L2 from L1 and vice versa. Many of these studies reported above-chance cross-language decoding accuracy, but the accuracy was still lower than that for within-language decoding (Correia et al., 2015; Sheikh et al., 2019b). This is especially the  case  when  more  complex  language  materials  such  as  stories  are involved (e.g., Dehghani et al. reported accuracy of 0.564 on average). Given this situation, it is necessary to compare brain decoding based on bilingual participants ' processing of two languages (L1 and L2) with brain decoding based on separate groups of monolinguals ' processing of the same languages (both L1). It is possible that proficient bilinguals know the words in both languages well, and brain decoding may reflect the effect of association of the word equivalents. In addition, the sociocultural experiences produce greater cross-language consistency within the same participant (the bilingual) than that between participants (two different  monolinguals),  such that  neural  representations  of  different languages  may  overlap  to  a  greater  extent  in  bilinguals  than  in  two monolingual groups.

It is also important to note that bilingual imaging studies have shown that  different  languages  are  represented  by  both  shared  and  distinct neural  patterns,  and  cross-language  decoding  may  fail  when  distinct neural  representations  occur  in  the  first  place.  Given  the  previous findings  on  distinct  neural  patterns  of  representation  (e.g.,  Li  et  al., 2004; Xu et al., 2017; Yang, Tan, &amp; Li,  2011)  and  given  our  earlier discussion  of  the  impact  of  language  similarity  on  cross-language decoding accuracy, further systematic investigations into different languages are needed to more fully understand the extent to which crosslanguage decoding is feasible across similar and distinct languages (e. g., English vs. Chinese).

5.2. Beyond concrete concepts and single words

Studies  of  within-language  decoding  have  shown  that  levels  of concreteness may be an important factor for brain decoding: the higher the  concreteness,  the  higher  the  decoding  accuracy  (e.g.,  Anderson, Murphy, &amp; Poesio,  2014;  Fernandino  et  al.,  2015).  Cross-language decoding studies have so far focused on decoding of a narrow range of concrete concepts (Buchweitz et al., 2012; Correia et al., 2014, 2015; Sheikh et al., 2019a, 2019b; Van de Putte et al., 2018; Zinszer et al., 2015), partly because concrete concepts are easier to test both in neuroimaging studies and computational modeling. The issue of whether cross-language decoding is feasible for abstract concepts remains largely unexplored. Unlike concrete concepts (e.g., ' apple ), abstract concepts ' (e.g.,  law ' ' ) do not have specific external referents, and it is unclear how cross-language decoding of abstract concepts might differ as a function of the variables discussed above (i.e., language similarity, AoA, proficiency, depth of processing). Further studies should address whether the similarity of neural representations of abstract concepts are sufficient for successful decoding across languages. Such studies would also advance our understanding of the brain organization of different word categories for different languages.

Another important direction of research is to extend cross-language brain decoding from single word/concepts to higher levels of sentences and discourses. Moving beyond the single-word level to sentenceand text- levels should be an important direction for the neuroscience of language research in general (see Hagoort, 2019). Earlier we reviewed two previous studies focused on the sentence level (Yang et al., 2017a,

2017b) and one on the discourse level (Dehghani et al., 2017), but many more studies on these levels are needed given their importance. Brain decoding at the sentence and discourse levels can be more complex and challenging than single word level, since higher-level language stimuli involve  additional  complexity  and  variations  of  the  words ' thematic role,  syntactic  features,  contextual  information,  and  structured  conceptual representation.

We hypothesize that discourse-level brain decoding may be more language-independent,  given  that,  unlike  meanings  of  single  words, meanings  of  text-based  paragraphs  and  narratives  may  not  differ significantly across languages. For example, language similarity may be more important to affect the accuracy of brain decoding at the word level, given the language-specific properties of word stimuli. In Chinese, for example, words may show different semantic relations due to their orthographic structures and similarities ( 氵 'water ' directly provides the semantic clues to all words that share this radical such as 河 'river ). At ' the discourse level, however, such language-specific properties are absent. Discourse processing involves multiple levels of processing that are not  language-specific,  including  coarse  semantic  processing,  topical coherence  monitoring,  text  integration,  interpreting  a  protagonist s ' perspective, mental model building and so on (see Mason &amp; Just, 2006 for a review). These processes activate a distributed network beyond the classical language areas (see Ferstl, Neumann, Bogler, &amp; Von Cramon, 2008;  Li &amp; Clariana,  2019  for  reviews).  Extant  studies  indicate  that neural activity associated with isolated words is primary driven by the properties of stimuli and accumulates information over relatively short time scales, while neural activity associated with narrative-level processing  in  high-order  areas  can  accumulate  information  over  longer periods of time (e.g., in areas such as precuneus, inferior frontal gyrus, medial frontal gyrus, temporoparietal cortex; Hasson, Yang, Vallines, Heeger, &amp; Rubin, 2008; Lerner, Honey, Silbert, &amp; Hasson, 2011). Toneva and Wehbe (2019) recently showed that brain activities during reading of  naturalistic  texts  in  the  frontal  and  parietal  regions  were  mostly predicted by long-range contextual representations, which are distinct from brain activities predicted by word-level representations (Toneva &amp; Wehbe, 2019).

5.3. From pattern classification to computational modeling

Previous studies of cross-language brain decoding have mainly been based  on  pattern  classification  methods  such  as  the  MVPA.  Such methods have enabled us to predict patterns of brain activity for stimuli of a language using a training set of stimuli of another language and its associated  neuroimaging  data.  An  alternative  approach  for  brain decoding  is  based  on  computational  modeling  (e.g.,  Mitchell  et  al., 2008), which enables us to test competing computational models and elucidate the extent to which the models are consistent with the stimulus representations in the brain. For example, Seyfried and Li (2020) used RSA to test context-dependent models (e.g., BERT, Devlin et al., 2018) and  context-independent  models  (e.g.,  fastText,  Bojanowski,  Grave, Joulin, &amp; Mikolov,  2017),  and  examined  the  degree  to  which  these computational models represented information processing in the brain. Future  studies  should  perform  brain  decoding  with  many  competing models,  each  explaining  a  portion  of  the  response-pattern  variance (Kriegeskorte, 2011).

A related issue is how to capture and integrate language-specific and culture-specific properties into brain decoding models. The neural representations of specific concepts or relations between concepts can be affected  by  cultural  factors  associated  with  different  languages.  For example,  discourse-level  processing  may  involve  background  knowledge that is not part of the text content proper, but historical or cultural knowledge  or  information  independent  of  the  semantic  content. Speakers  of  different  languages  and  cultures  have  their  own  unique experience of the same word or concept due to different environments, including the concepts ' cognitive and affective properties (Kuang, Li, Chen, Jin, &amp; Chen, 2012). For example, the word  red ' ' refers to a visual

GLYPH&lt;0&gt;GLYPH&lt;11&gt;GLYPH&lt;0&gt;GLYPH&lt;21&gt;GLYPH&lt;0&gt;

M. Xu et al.

GLYPH&lt;0&gt;GLYPH&lt;21&gt;GLYPH&lt;0&gt;GLYPH&lt;20&gt;GLYPH&lt;0&gt;GLYPH&lt;24&gt;

color in both English and Chinese, but in the Chinese culture it is also associated  with  celebration,  enthusiasm,  and  happiness,  while  in Western cultures, it can be associated with debt, loss, and anguish. For these  kinds  of  concepts,  cross-language  decoding  accuracy  may  be influenced by the extent to which the bilingual materials share similar cognitive, affective, and emotionality properties (see Pavlenko, 2012 for discussion). At the same time, successes or failures of cross-language decoding  could  inform  us  of  the  significance  of  these  nonlinguistic properties in the neural representation of language and concept. Previous work (Yang et al., 2016) has shown that certain regions in the brain, such as the right angular gyrus, may become particularly activated when processing information related to cultural background knowledge in the case of Chinese idioms. Such language-specific and culture-specific cases and their neural correlates suggest that cross-language decoding (from English  to  Chinese  or  vice  versa)  may  be  more  challenging  than  we think.

6. Conclusions

Recent advances in machine learning research have opened up new ways  for  investigating  the  neural  representation  of  language  in  the brain. Brain decoding has been an exciting and rapidly developing topic in this regard. Cross-language brain decoding has the potential to provide new insights into how our brain represents multiple languages. Our review of recent studies in cross-language brain decoding indicates that it is possible to decode semantic information across different languages from neuroimaging data, but there are also significant challenges to its success.  Factors  such  as  cross-language  similarity,  AoA/proficiency levels, depth of language processing may all affect the effectiveness of cross-language decoding. We expect to see continued progress in crosslanguage  decoding,  from  a  traditional  focus  on  words  and  concrete concepts  toward  the  use  of  naturalistic  experimental  tasks  involving higher-level language processing (e.g., discourse processing). The crosslanguage decoding approach can also be applied to understand how cross-modal,  cross-cultural,  and  other  nonlinguistic  cognitive  and  affective  factors  may  influence  neural  representations  of  different  languages. We need to design such studies with theoretical frameworks and hypotheses,  which  will  in  turn  inform  and  contribute  to  the  understanding of the cortical representations of different languages. Finally, future  developments  in  both  neuroimaging  techniques  and  machine learning algorithms will allow us to capture highly detailed spatial and temporal  information  as  language  processing  unfolds  in  real  time, thereby enabling language and cross-language brain decoding with high fidelity.
